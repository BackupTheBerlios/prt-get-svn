0.6.0:
- Actions/Commands
  - Help per command
- Dynamic command binding
- common check for minArgs maxArgs exactArgs
- abstract core and client (e.g. install and installtransaction)
- Make InstallTransaction a real install transaction:
  - rollback pre-install if package building failed
  - needs heavy refactoring to be easier to understand/maintain
- Test mode: global (is duplicated right now)
- remove should be in a transaction as well
  - remove transaction
  - install transaction
  - etc.
  - Transaction handler
- better examples for man page

0.5.x:

[ ] timestamps for the log file 
[ ] --quiet mode; suppress output of pkgmk and pkgadd
[ ] create a separate port for the bash-completion

???
[ ] prt-get rm and cd
[ ] cache file class, help class
[ ] interrupt handler (ctrl-c) kill pkgmk/pkgadd, delete lock files, say
    "prt-get: action cancelled"; warn when cancel during download ->
    STATE variable, separate download and build.
[ ] lock files for log, cache (lock file class)
[ ] direct options for -im, -uf, -fr (force rebuild), -fi (force install)
[ ] move command name out of execTransaction (would be wrong for e.g.
    sysup)
[ ] prt-get diff stats: "100 Packages with differences"


SHORT TERM
------------

* Answer FAQs

* create a fileExists(), createDir() etc helper class

* questions
  - should the install/update result include the version/release?

* cosmetic
  - move all output messages to prtget.cpp (away from main.cpp)
  - remove "using namespace std" from header file

* test
  - add asserts

* functional
  - check exit messages (strings). always add 'prt-get'
  - simple version handling to mark ports older in the repository than
    installed (Done; disabled)
  
* refactor
  - check operations in prtget.cpp for common code
  - make InstallTransaction more modular (download/build/install)

LONG TERM
------------------------------
* remove quickdiff
* move find command into list --filter="..." ???

* symbolic exit codes

* new commands:

* questions:
  - should there be a install/update mixed to mode, to install and update,
    which ever method is needed?
  - namespace prtget ? 
  - remove the path:package1, package2 filter functionality from the
    config file again. This could be done by creating another ports
    directories an creation symlinks there to. Could improve performance
  - might people like ansi colors?

* new features
  - list shadow packages (dup) for arguments 


LONG LONG TERM
--------------
- parallel download for installing/updating multiple packages (at least
  download of 2nd package while building first)
